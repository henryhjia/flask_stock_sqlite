# Secure Stock Price Viewer 
## Project Overview

**Stock Price Viewer** is an enhanced version of the Stock Price Viewer application, designed to provide user authentication and secure data access.
The application is developed **with the help of AI-assisted programming using Gemini Pro 2.5,** improving development speed and reliability.

This app introduces a user registration and login system, ensuring that only registered users can access the stock data retrieval features.

Once logged in, users enter required fields:

- **Stock Ticker**
- **Start Date**
- **End Date**

The app will:

- Retrieve historical stock prices for the specified date range from Yahoo Finance.
- Generate a plot of stock price versus date for easy visualization.
- Display the most recent stock price, covering up to the last 20 days.

The application uses an **SQLite database** to manage user credentials and store application data.
It runs locally and does **not involve deployment to Google Cloud Platform (GCP).**
